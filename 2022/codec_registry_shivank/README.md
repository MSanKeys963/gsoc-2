## Project Information
Project Idea: Zarr is a format for compressed N-Dimensional arrays and uses many compression algorithms to handle the data. Each of these compression algorithms is bound with an identifier to identify them, But we donâ€™t have any registry to help other languages identify them. To fill this gap we need a registry to be defined for these codecs which is human-readable as well as machine-readable.  

**Project length:** 175 hrs

# Project Weekly Updates:

## Pre-GSoC Work
* Created a Research file.
* Documented several codecs into this format.
```
* Blosc
- A brief about how the compression technique works(2-3 lines)
- Where the codec is primarily used(webpages, PNGs, JPEGs, OS etc.)
- Comparing compression and decompression benchmarks/speeds
- Any other info you think is useful
- Important links for the codec(GitHub, Blog post, Implementations etc.)
```
* Created an initial version of Research file on Codecs.
* Created a Pull Request for [Pre-commit configuration](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1015)
