## Participation through the years üóì

### Google Summer of Code 2022

Zarr participated in GSoC 2022 for the first time. After reviewing several applications, we shortlisted two contributors to work with us for Summer 2022. They are:

- [Shivank Chaudhary](https://github.com/alt-shivam) for [Building Codes Registry](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/g4IPN5HL)
- [Parth Tripathi](https://github.com/parthxtripathi/) for [Benchmarking Zarr Implementations](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/qa93Xk9L)

Both these contributors are being mentored by [Josh Moore](https://github.com/joshmoore) and [Sanket Verma](https://github.com/MSanKeys963).
